- **Question Management**: Individual question cards with AI solutions
- **Solution Display**: Step-by-step reasoning with confidence scores

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model Transformation
```typescript
// OLD: Generic session model
interface SessionData {
  participants: number
  duration: string
  recordAudio: boolean
}

// NEW: Exam-focused model
interface SessionData {
  examBoard: 'Edexcel' | 'AQA' | 'OCR' | 'WJEC'
  subject: 'Physics' | 'Mathematics' | 'Chemistry' | 'Biology'
  papers: ExamPaper[]
  totalQuestions: number
  solvedQuestions: number
  avgAccuracy: number
}
```

### Status System
- **Session Statuses**: `draft` â†’ `processing` â†’ `completed` â†’ `error`
- **Paper Statuses**: `uploaded` â†’ `processing` â†’ `parsed` â†’ `solved` â†’ `error`  
- **Question Statuses**: `pending` â†’ `solving` â†’ `solved` â†’ `error`

### UI Components
- **Upload Zone**: Drag-and-drop with file validation
- **Progress Indicators**: Animated status badges and progress bars
- **Solution Cards**: Expandable question cards with AI-generated answers
- **Action Buttons**: Context-aware processing controls
